TO INSTALL
1. Follow user guide for hdf5 and CHOMBO
   We used hdf5-1.8.13 and CHOMBO original:
      svn --username username co -r21668 https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/svn/Chombo/release/3.2 Chombo-3.2      
   because all newer patches broke it. Also, cmake 3.5 and 3.6 DON'T WORK!! 3.9 does. 
   As well as the make_all_chombo.sh (slightly different from Alex's).
   On occigen I am using gnu/6.0.2 opempi cmake/3.9.0

2. Change CMakeList.txt in the root folder (PATHS)

TO SET UP PROBLEM
0. Start from a directory in Real_Problems or Test_problems (Outdflows)
1. Edit CMakeLists.txt in there (PARALLEL, PHYSICS)
2. Edit definitions.h      (things have to match with CMakeLists; PLUTO's stuff + listing user_def parameters)
3. Edit definitions_usr.h  (Editing the problem-specific parameters; e.g. DUMPING VS PRIMITIVE)
4. Set pluto.ini           (straighforward runtime parameters #PAR_OXXX are for outflows, #PAR_HXXX for hot halo, ...)
5. rm CMakeFiles -rf; cmake .
6. make -j 
7. link pluto.ini in binary folder

THINGS THAT CAME OUT
userdef_output.c - controls output fields, the ChangeDumpVar is output-specific; may give some trouble
